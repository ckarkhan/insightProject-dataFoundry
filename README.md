This is my project at Insight Data Engineering. 

PROBLEM STATEMENT
Meta-data around image files is usually not that rich. Feeding such low quality data to ML models for 
training purposes usually results in predictions that are not very accurate. This may lead to a 
frustrating experience for the data scientist who has built the model.

SOLUTION
One possible approach to solve this problem may be to give the data scientist community the ability to 
augment the default metadata accompanying the image(s) with meaningful metadata via a web application 
and/or an API interface. Over time, this image dataset will grow rich with data supplied by DS and can 
be used by DS for training their models. This will lead to data democratization where the data is 
created 'by the DS, for the DS'.
